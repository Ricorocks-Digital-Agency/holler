# Holler

Holler is a Laravel package designed to make database notifications more consistent across projects. 

Notifications tend to have the same set of properties: a title, details, icon and URL. However, the loose nature
of database notifications can cause real complexity if handled carelessly. Holler enforces a consistent approach
to database notifications, which both simplifies your code and makes UI design easier.
